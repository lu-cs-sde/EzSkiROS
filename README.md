# EzSkiROS

This repository contains the **replication packege of EzSkiROS** an embedded Domain-Specific Language to describe robotic skills in SkiROS. EzSkiROS allows robot developers to catch bugs in the SkillDescription at launch time, i.e., before running the robot.

This repository is spearated in two parts: 
- [ezskiros-docker](ezskiros-docker) -> Contains the instructions to get EzSkiROS running. Can be used for code inspection, running simulations, running tests.
- [online-questionnaire](online-questionnaire) -> Contains the artifacts generated in our user study.
