# EzSkiROS Evaluation: User Study

To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the EzSkiROS, we conducted a user evaluation with robotics experts. 
In this section, we document the artifacts generated in the User Study for the sake of verifiability and replicability. 
The User study consisted in (1) inviting robot experts to participating on our study, then (2) asking them to answer an online questionnaire, (3) analysing the results of the questionnaire.
